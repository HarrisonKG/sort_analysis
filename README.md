HW 1


This project implements insertion, merge, and stooge sort, and compares their runtimes to illustrate the differences in asymptotic complexity. 


  You can run the code with the commands  python3 insertsort.py  and  python3 mergesort.py  and python3 stoogesort.py
  
  The programs read in arrays from data.txt and send output to <insert/merge/stooge>.out
